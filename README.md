This repository contains the work conducted during a research internship focused on developing a sustainability maturity model for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) using various machine learning algorithms. The aim of this project is to assess and predict the sustainability maturity levels of MSMEs based on diverse input features.

Project Highlights

1.Extensive Literature Review: Conducted a thorough review of existing sustainability assessment frameworks and models applicable to MSMEs.

2.Data Collection: Gathered comprehensive data from industry reports, government databases, and company surveys to create a robust dataset.

3.Machine Learning Implementation: Employed various machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Bayesian algorithms, Random Forest, and Neural Networks(NN) to predict sustainability maturity levels.

4.Feature Engineering: Selected and engineered relevant features from the collected data to improve model performance.

5.Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of each machine learning model using standard metrics.

6.Documentation: Prepared detailed documentation adhering to academic standards, outlining the methodology, algorithms used, data collection process, and findings.
